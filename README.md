Our project will be to make a differential equation solver and visualizer. Users will input an equation. This will then be visualized with a graph, with the solution also on the graph. Students can also input an initial value to set the placement of the solution curve. Additionally, we plan to write out the steps to solve the differential equation. 

Define Objectives:

Each student should define and contribute their individual objectives for the project, along with proposing overall objectives for the team.
Collaborate as a team to refine and finalize a cohesive set of objectives that align with the project’s overarching goals.
Select Technologies and Tools:
- python and matlab

Discuss and agree on the programming languages, tools, and frameworks that will be used for the project.
Create a Project Timeline:

Develop a detailed timeline outlining key milestones.
Include specific tasks, responsibilities, and deadlines for each phase of the project.
Document the Plan:

Each team member should contribute to a PDF document that includes:
Project scope
Individual and team objectives
Project plan and timeline
Upload the final PDF document to your project’s GitHub repository.
Share the GitHub link as part of your final project submission.
